            <description><![CDATA[In my quest to understand type theory, I came across
links to two very good books. The first,
Programming Language Foundations in Agda,
by Philip Wadler, is available online.  The second,
Verified Functional Programming in Agda, by Aaron Stump,
is avaialble from Amazon for $79.95 paperback, $51.19 kindle.
Ouf! Maybe less expensive elsewhere.

Some time ago, I read James Gleick's book *The Information: a History,

using the Euterpea library.  It is useful to compute its cycle length: the smallest number of beats after which the piece repeats itself. This turns out to be 156780 beats. At a metronome marking
of 120 beats per minute, that means 21 hours 46 minutes and 30 seconds
 of music.  Whew!

With the cycle length in hand, one
can construct a one-cycle finite version of the piece.

Then add small random increments dx and dy, say in the range from -1 to +1 to get

dx and dy in the same range.  Let (x2, y2) = (x1 + dx. y1 + dy).  Do this
