**Current interests:** Type theory (Martin-Löf, HoTT) and functional programming, mostly Elm and Futhark.  Some projects:

- Building **[MiniLaTeX](https://minilatex.io/)**, a subset of LaTeX that can be rendered to HTML.  The most interesting part is the parser-renderer, which is written in Elm.   I've used it for [some lecture notes](https://knode.io/424) and various other little projects.

  MathJax.Hub.Config({
  	'showProcessingMessages': false,
  	'messageStyle': 'none'
  });

- Learning **Type Theory**.  Absolutely fascinating, touching everything from philosophy to logic to mathematics to programming.  What more could one ask for?  Currently reading _[Programming Language Foundations in Agda](https://plfa.github.io/)_, by Philip Wadler and _Verified Functional Programming in Agda_, by Aaron Stump.  Both are based on Per Martin-Löf's work and both give down-to-earth treatments of how to prove theorems using type theory.

* [Tarring Files in Elm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ir4sZLIznNI) — a package written in pure Elm to tar and untar files. Oslo Elm Day, Feb 16, 2019.  Wow, was the hospitality great!

Take a look at [MiniLaTeX Demo](https://demo.minilatex.app/) for a little editor that you can experiment with.  Two panels: source text on the left, rendered text on the right. No login required.

**Delivering content**

There are many ways to deliver MiniLaTeX content to colleagues, students, or the general public. One vehicle is the [MiniLaTeX Reader](https://reader.minilatex.app/).  It can sit inside any web page, along with other material.  The app itself is configured to point at MiniLaTeX Notebook: a set of related documents such as a set of lecture notes.  The Reader can be used to access other MiniLaTeX documents as well those to which it points by default.  An institution can deploy as many Readers on its pages as it needs.

Another vehicle is [knode.io](https://knode.io) — *k* for knowldge.  This is a full content management system. To create content, an author simply registers for an account and begins using  the two-panel editor as with [MiniLaTeX Live](https://jxxcarlson.github.io/app/miniLatexLive/index.html).  Once the author makes the document public, it is accessible to everyone.

I'm a professor emeritus of Mathematics at the University of Utah, presently visiting the Ohio State University.  For the last seven years, I have also held a visitig scholar position at BICMR,
the Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research at Peking University. Next year (2019-20), I will be visiting the Collège de France in Paris. After that, back to New York City.

**Use in courses**

 MiniLaTeX has been used for courses at the Beijing International Center For Mathematical Research (BICMR), Ohio State University and Colorado State University. Here is one example, a set of lecture notes for a course I taught at BICMR and OSU: [Notes on Quantum Field Theory](https://knode.io/427).

PS. I am giving a talk on MiniLaTeX on Friday, June 9 at [Lambda Conf 2019](https://lambdaconf.zohobackstage.com/LambdaConf2019?lang=en#/agenda?day=3&lang=en&sessionId=6967000000359716) in Boulder Colorado.
