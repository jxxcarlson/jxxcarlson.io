**Current interests:** Type theory and functional programming, mostly Elm and Futhark.  Some projects:

- Building **MiniLaTeX** a subset of LaTeX that can be rendered to HTML.  The most interesting part the parser-renderer, which is written in Elm.   I've used it for [some lecture notes](https://knode.io/424) and various other little projects.

- Learning **[Futhark](https://futhark-lang.org/)**, the awesome pure functional language that compiles to highly optimized GPU code.  I'm [writing notes on Futhark](https://knode.io/1242) as my studies progress.

- Studying **Type Theory**.  Absolutely fascinating, touching everything from philosophy to logic to mathematics, to programming.  What more could one ask for?
