I've been accepted at the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com)
for the session beginning September 21, 2020.
It will be twelve weeks pure joy, work, and learning, with
all control knobs set to 10. Have looked over the profiles
of some of the other RC participants.  Amazing in variety of interests and experience.


About what to learn.  I've made a go at Haskell several times, but have never
reached the point at which I can confidently build things
with it.  At RC, there is a lot of interest in functional
programming in general and Haskell in particular, so maybe now is the time.
RC has some good [online resources](https://github.com/recursecenter/wiki/wiki/Haskell-Resources), and
Brent Yorgey's [CIS 194 course at U Penn](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures.html)
looks especially nice.

If I am to learn Haskell, I need to build something with it.  One possibility is
generative music.  There is a great reference for this: Paul Hudak's book,
**The Haskell School of Music.**  Working through it
could be part of something quite ambitious
that I've been thinking about:

> Create a declarative language for writing a "score" that would direct an
algorithmically created performance.  The score would define both aural and
visual elements, coordinating their initiation, coordination, and evolution
over time.  In terms of eventual performances, I'm thinking along the
lines of the Processing project
[Seurat](https://wordpress.com/view/square-the-circle.com)
which I wrote many years ago (2013).  It turns out that I still have the
[code](https://github.com/jxxcarlson/Processing/tree/master/seurat).
Performance of Seurat is controlled by an Arduino, and I've found the
[code for that too](https://github.com/jxxcarlson/Processing/tree/master/Sensors).
The Arduino has to be connected to a
[control box with some potentiometers](https://square-the-circle.com/2013/05/02/seurat-square/).

Here is one frame from that processing program created long ago:
