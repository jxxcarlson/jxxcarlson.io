This guide is a little log that I ~~wrote~~ am writing
while reading the book *The Haskell School of Music**,
by Paul Hudak and Donya Quick.

## Chapter 2

### Preliminaries

I've found that good practice when starting a session
with Euterpea is to check which device Euterpea will
be talking to:

```
> devices

Input devices:
  InputDeviceID 0       IAC Driver Bus 1

Output devices:
  OutputDeviceID 1      IAC Driver Bus 1
  OutputDeviceID 2      sforzando
```

Channel 1, doesn't work for me, so I use channel 2,
like this:

```
> playDev 2 $ c 4 qn
```

This will play a quarter note C in octave 4.
For convenience, I define `p = playDev 2` so that it
is enough to say

```
> p $ c 4 qn
```

### Note

My reading of the text is that
note (1/2) (C,4) should produce a Music Pitch
value and therefore be playable.  Alas, this
is not the case:

```
> :t note (1/2) (C,4)
note (1/2) (C,4) :: Num b => Music (PitchClass, b)
```

By comparison, we have this, which does produce
a playable value:

```
> :t note (1/2) (mp C 4)
note (1/2) (mp C 4) :: Music Pitch
```


Go figure!  So we introduce the function mp
(make pitch):

```
mp :: PitchClass -> Int ->  Pitch
mp  pitchClass octave =
    (pitchClass, octave)
```

Let's check it out:

```
> import Experiments
> p $ note (1/2) (mp C 4)
-- A half note C in octave 4 is played
```  

Note, however, that one has convenient functions for
constructing notes:

```
c :: Octave -> Dur -> Music Pitch
cf :: Octave -> Dur -> Music Pitch
cs :: Octave -> Dur -> Music Pitch
```

### Making Music: Notes in Sequence  

Let's put some notes together to make a simple melody.
First, some useful (to me abbreviations):

```
do1 = c 4 qn  -- can't use "do". It is reserved word.
> re = d 4 qn
> mi = e 4 qn
```

The operator `:+:` is used to glue notes together in
sequence:

```
> mel = do1 :+: re :+: mi :+: do1
> p mel
```

Recognize it?

**Note**: it is important to always know the types of the
things you are working with. It is easy to recall these.
For example:

```
> :t (:+:)
(:+:) :: Music a -> Music a -> Music a
```

#### Addendum

We complete the scale for later use.

```
> fa = f 4 qn
> sol = g 4 qn
> la = a 4
> la = a 4 qn
> si = b 4 qn
```

### Making Music: Notes in Parallel  

Next, let's harmonize our melody.  To do this,
we use the operator `:=:` to play notes in parallel.
Thus, we can construct a C major triad like this

```
> triad = do1 :=: mi :=: sol
```  

Let's harmonize our melody in parallel thirds:

```
> mel2 = mi :+: fa :+: sol :+: mi
> hmel = mel :=: mel2
```

We could have done this in another way, first constructing
`do1 :=: mi`, then `re :=: fa`, etc., and then putting them
in sequence.
