This post describes my travails setting up Euterpea on a Mac (OS 10.15.6).

Suggestions for improving the procedure are most welcome. It would be
very good if someone could verify the procedure on a "clean" machine
to ensure that it is correct, complete, and *reproducible.*  While the
instructions below are by no means the only way to install and configure Euterpea, they do work.

There are a number of steps and challenges:

1. Installing GHC  
2. Installing Euterpea
3. Installing a synthesizer
4. Configuring the synthesizer
5. Testing

## 1. Installing GHC  

I used the installer at [haskell.org](https://www.haskell.org/platform/mac.html).
It gives you ghc, cabal, and stack.

This part went well.

## 2. Installing Euterpea  

This is tricky. The best resource is
the [download and installation page](http://www.euterpea.com/download-and-installation/) of
[euterpea.com](http://www.euterpea.com/).
It is important to use the right version of GHC in installing Euterpea. If you
do not, installation will fail.  It is recommended to use cabal for installation,
but I prefer stack.  It is possible it do this with [the correct instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53977864/installing-euterpea-for-computer-music-applications-and-haskell#comment94979685_54072767).
Here is what to do.

### Set up a new project: `stack new euterpea`

If you do `cd euterpea`, you get this:

```
$ tree
.
├── ChangeLog.md
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── Setup.hs
├── app
│   └── Main.hs
├── eutx.cabal
├── package.yaml
├── src
│   └── Lib.hs
├── stack.yaml
└── test
   └── Spec.hs
```

#### Getting the correct version of GCH

Look at `stack.yaml` and find the line which looks something
like `resolver: lts-16.13`. The `lts`
stands for *long-time support*. This line determines the version of
GHC.  The version numbers for `lts` and `ghc` are not the same.

According to the [download and installation page](http://www.euterpea.com/download-and-installation/),
you must use a GHC version in the range 8.2 through 8.6.5. Change
`lts-*.*`  to `lts-12.26`.  This will ensure that GHC 8.4.4 is used.
If you now run `stack ghci`, GHCi will come up, reporting version 8.4.4.


#### Setting the dependencies (stack.yaml)

Still in `stack.yaml`, define the extra dependencies:

```
extra-deps:
- Euterpea-2.0.6
- PortMidi-0.1.6.1
- arrows-0.4.4.2
- Stream-0.4.7.2
- lazysmallcheck-0.6
```

#### Setting the dependencies (package.yaml)

Modify `package.yaml` so that the `dependencies` section looks like this:

```
dependencies:
- base >= 4.7 && < 5
- Euterpea
```

Run `stack ghci` again, and try this:

```
*Main Lib> import Euterpea
*Main Lib Euterpea> note (1/4) (A, 4)
Prim (Note (1 % 4) (A,4))
```

If you get as far as seeing `Prim (Note (1 % 4) (A,4))`, you know that Euterpea is
properly installed.

## 3. Installing a synthesizer

Running the Euterpea code `playDev 0 $ c 4 qn` sends a MIDI command to
the configured synthesizer on channel 0, producing a quarter-note C in octave 4.
The synthesizer receives MIDI commands and turns it into sound. Our tasks are to
install a synthesizer and configure the communication between it and Euterpea.

#### The synthesizer

Donya Quick's [MIDI page](http://www.donyaquick.com/working-with-midi-on-mac-os-x/),
last modified Sep 13, 2019, has lots of good information. There are a number of
options, among which are

1. SimpleSynth
2. fluidsynth (use `brew install fluidsynth`)
3. [Sforzando](https://www.plogue.com/downloads.html#sforzando)

The first does not work with Mac OS 10.15.6.  I could not
get audible sound from the second. I believe one needs
to set the MIDI instrument for the program, but I could
not figure out how to do that.  The third option worked
just fine, and so I recommend it.


## 4. Configuring the synthesizer

Follow the directions on [Donya Quick's page](http://www.donyaquick.com/working-with-midi-on-mac-os-x/).
section 2.  Below is an extract of her directions.

1. Find **Audio MIDI Studio**
in `/Applications` and double-click on it.

1. If you are lucky, you will get 2-3 windows that open up and one of them will be called “MIDI Studio.” If you don’t see that window, go up to the top left of the screen and go to
Audio MIDI Setup > Preferences and make sure the box called “MIDI Window” is ticked.

2. Once you have MIDI Studio open, double-click on “IAC Driver.”

3. There should be a list called “Ports.” If this is empty, you don’t have any ports set up. To add a new port, click the “+” button. This port will now always be there (potentially unless you upgrade your OS version – then you might need to go through these steps again).

4. You can manage the ports you have as you need new ones or if you want to remove some later. Typically it’s good to have at least 2 ports at any given time. You can give your ports meaningful names if you want by double-clicking the name of the port.

**NOTE:** The above may not be necessary. Some synthesizers open virtual ports by themselves.
I have not been able to test this, so please let me know if the above is always necessary.

## 5. Testing

Once you have your synthesizer(s) installed, you should
test to see if Euterpea can see them.  Note that you
must start your syntesizer *before* you start Euterpea.

Here is what I got:

```
*Main Lib Euterpea> devices

Input devices:
  InputDeviceID 0	IAC Driver Bus 1

Output devices:
  OutputDeviceID 1	IAC Driver Bus 1
  OutputDeviceID 2	FluidSynth virtual port (48276)
  OutputDeviceID 3	sforzando
```

In this case, Euterpea sees three devices.  I used the
third to play a note:

```
*Main Lib Euterpea> playDev 3 $ c 4 qn
```

If you hear a quarter-note C, you know that Euterpea works for you.
Time to celebrate!

## Now for some music

There is a [page of resources and things to try](http://euterpea.com/examples/) when
starting out, e.g:

```
playDev 3 $ line [c 4 qn, c 4 qn, g 4 qn, g 4 qn, a 4 qn, a 4 qn, g 4 hn]
```

If you have configured things the right way (I haven't), you can
use `play` instead of `playDev 3`.

## Something more elaborate

The examples below are taken from
[Euterpea2-Examples/NoteLevel/BlueLambda.lhs](https://github.com/Euterpea/Euterpea2-Examples/blob/master/NoteLevel/BlueLambda.lhs)

```
> x1 = c 4 en :+: g 4 en :+: c 5 en :+: g 5 en
> x2 = x1 :+: transpose 3 x1
> x3 = x2 :+: x2 :+: invert x2 :+: retro x2
> x4 = forever x3 :=: forever (tempo (2/3) x3)
> playDev 3 x4
```

As explained the first chapter of Hudak and Quick's book,
*The Haskell School of Music,* playing `foo :+: bar` is
to play `foo`, then `bar`, while `foo :=: bar` is to
play `foo` and `bar` simultaneously.

The version below introduces a half-note offset:

```
> x4' = forever x3 :=: (rest hn :+: forever (tempo (2/3) x3))
> playDev 3 x4'
```
