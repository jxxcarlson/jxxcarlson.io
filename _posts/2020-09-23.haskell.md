### CIS 194 (Brent Yorgey, U Penn)

[My solutions (ahem!)](https://github.com/jxxcarlson/cis194)

- [Supplementary exercise on ordered trees](https://github.com/jxxcarlson/cis194/blob/master/Supplement/Tree.hs)

- [Homework 11, baby Lisp eval](https://github.com/jxxcarlson/cis194/blob/master/hw11/SExpr.hs).  *Very
  limited*, but it can do this:

  ```
  > eval "(product 2 (sum 3 4))"
    Just (Num 14)
  ```

  and do limited error reporting:

  ```
  > eval "(product 2 (sum 3 4)"
    Just BadSExpr
  ```
