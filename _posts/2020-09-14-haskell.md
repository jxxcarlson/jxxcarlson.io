## Initial setup

We will run `stack new PROJECTNAME` to start
a new project.  This sets up a project with the file
`./app/Main.hs`, which looks like this:

```
module Main where

import Lib

main :: IO ()
main = someFunc
```

If we look at `.src/Lib.h`, we find the below:

```
module Lib ( someFunc ) where

someFunc :: IO ()
someFunc = putStrLn "someFunc"
```

Thus, running the program `Main.hs` should
print "someFunc".   Let's see if we can do all
this:


```
$ stack new randomStuff
$ stack ghci
*Main Lib> main
someFunc
```

Success!

## Adding a package

We are going to add code to our program so that
it prints out a random number.  For this we
will use the module `System.Random`.  We'll
need to find the name of the package that
exposes this module.  Googling "haskell System.Random",
we find [this page](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/random-1.2.0/docs/System-Random.html).
Looking at it closely, in fine print at the top, is the text

```
random-1.2.0: Pseudo-random number generation
```

This is our clue.  So we put the line `- random` in the file `package.yaml`
in just the right place, like so:

```
dependencies:
- base >= 4.7 && < 5
- random -- << NEW TEXT
```

Then we change `Main.hs` so that it looks like this:

```
module Main where

import Lib
import System.Random

main :: IO ()
main = someFunc

newRand = randomIO :: IO Int
```

Thus, we have imported the module `System.Random`
and used it to define `newRand`.  Before proceeding
further, we test to see if this works:

```
$ stack ghci

*Main Lib> newRand
1095906040554822953

*Main Lib> newRand
2091178867183333176
```

Yes!  Making progress.

## Finishing the program

We've tested `randomIO`, and it works.  But we
would like to integrate it into our program
so that when we run our program, it prints
a random number to the screen.  Below is
one solution.

```
module Main where

import System.Random

main :: IO ()
main = newRand >>= print

newRand = randomIO :: IO Int
```

## Understanding the program

To understand the program, we need to understand how the  
types fit together.  For this we will use [Hoogle](https://hoogle.haskell.org/),
a search tool for functions and values.  For example, if we put `main` in
the search box, we find that `main : IO ()`.  That is, `main` has type `IO ()`.
Thus, if we say `main = whatever`, then `whatever` must also have type `IO ()`.
Now `newRand` has type `IO Int`, and if search for `print` using Hoogle, we find
this:

```
Show a => a -> IO ()
```

What this means is that `print`  has type `a -> IO a`,
but where `a` is constrained to be of typeclass `Show a`.  
This of typeclass `Show a` are printable.  So we have something
of type `IO Int` and a function of type `a -> IO ()`, e.g., of
type `Int -> IO ()`. From these, we want to produce something of
type  `IO ()`.  Suppose we had an function `op` that could do this, so
that

```
rewRand `op` print :: IO ()
```
