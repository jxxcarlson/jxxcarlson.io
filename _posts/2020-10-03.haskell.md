It is the end of my second week at [RC](https://recurse.com), 
and I've decided to have a go
at building a small project using Servant, the Haskell webserver library.
The idea is to construct a PDF server — let's call it *pdfServer.io* —
for files written in MiniLaTeX.  The flow of data goes like this:

  1.  A user requests a PDF of a MiniLaTeX document.
  2. [minilatex.lamdera.app](https://minilatex.lamdera.app) sends a
     POST request to *pdfServer.io* with the source text of the document.
  3. *pdfServer.io* runs `xelatex` on the data received and stores the
     resulting PDF file.
  4. *pdfServer.io* replies to the POST request with a URL,
     `https://pdfServer/pdf/ab1234`, where `ab1234` is the
     id of the generated PDF file.
  5. When the URL is received by the MiniLaTeX app, it presents it
     as a clickable link.
  6. The user clicks on the link, making a GET request to *pdfLatex.io*.
  7. *pdfLatex.io* replies with the PDF file, which either loads in
     the browser or is downloaded to disk, depending on the user's browser
     and settings.

The documentation for Servant is especially good.  Here are the basic references,
together with some examples

   - [Github Repo](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant)
   - [Tutorial](http://docs.servant.dev/en/stable/tutorial/index.html)
   - [Minimal Example](https://github.com/haskell-servant/example-servant-minimal) — 48 lines of code!
   - [Simple Example with Data Persistence](https://github.com/haskell-servant/example-servant-persistent) -- 94 lines of code
   - [Cookbook](https://docs.servant.dev/en/stable/cookbook/index.html)
   - [Core Documentation](https://docs.servant.dev/en/stable/)

I am still studying the docs and trying out little examples.  Hope to get the project
going shortly.  But as a taste of how awesome Servant is, try out the minimal example.
Then look look at the tutorial, which explains how one can do so much with so few lines
of code.
