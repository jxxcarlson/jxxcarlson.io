# RC Friday Show

*November 19, 2020* 

The pieces below were written using Paul Hudak's Haskell library, *Euterpea*.
I've learned everything that went into these compositions from *The Haskell School of Music*,
by Paul Hudak and Donya Quick, and also from [Donya Quick's website](http://donyaquick.com/).

Here is the [repo for the code](https://github.com/jxxcarlson/euterpea-exercises).  The 
repo is badly in need of some cleanup and editing.  Soon!


Later I will add some short notes about the compositional process for the below.
