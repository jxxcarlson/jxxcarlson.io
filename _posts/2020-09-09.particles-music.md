*((To be updated periodically, as my ideas take form (or crash)))*

This post is to outline some ideas for what might be my RC project
and to collect some references for it.  The idea is to be able to
write a score or program for producing a generative film coupled
with a generative sound track.   For the film score,
I'm considering Euterpea, so that makes some kind of
Haskell program the logical choice for the generative film.
Something like my old 2013 Processing
project [Seurat](https://wordpress.com/view/square-the-circle.com),
but more sophisticated and flexible.

> (2013) *As I recall,
the film part of the Processing project was essentially a stochastic
particle system that used Brownian motion and also some sine waves of
different, maybe incommensurable periods to regulate the pacing, density,
etcetera of the film.  (Same for the audio).*

I'll collect some references on particle systems in Haskell and see if
this is a feasible approach.
