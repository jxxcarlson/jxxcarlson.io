- 9/8/2020: Push new version of [jxxcarlson/elm-lisp](https://github.com/jxxcarlson/elm-lisp).
  The repo is cleaned up and I've added a [Blackbox repl](https://medium.com/@jxxcarlson/running-elm-as-a-blackbox-b1930592054b).  The elm-lisp is a skeleton for making a tiny typed Lisp,
  and is intended for (my) educational purposes only.

- 9/7/2020: Publish [Umuli app](https://jxxcarlson.github.io/app/umuli/).  
  UMULI = Universal Markup Language Interface.
  Demonstrates a method for hosting multiple markup languages for
  editing and live-rendering.  This app still has KaTeX rendering issues.

- 9/7/2020: Expose `Markdown.Data` in Markdown project so that the library
  exports all that is needed for the UMULI interface.  Bump to version 9.6.0.
  KaTeX works fine in the [Simple demo app](https://markdown.minilatex.app). q

- 9/1/2020: Add `Markdown.LaTeX.export` for converting markdown to LaTeX.  Bump
  to version 9.4.0.
