title: "MiniLaTeX: Plans for 2019-20"
tags: minilatex

I'll be spending the 2019-20 academic year in Paris at the
Coll√®ge de France.  My plan is to work on type theory
and MiniLaTeX, with the aim (for the latter) of rolling out some significant
improvements -- the parser, renderer,
and the apps in which it is used.  Two subprojects in particular:
(a) do a Haskell implementation of the parser, (b) write a specification
for MiniLaTeX and show that both the new Haskell and the
existing (or improved) Elm implementations
satisfy the specification.  The reason for (a) is first to have way to
cross-validate parsing and second to show that the technology
is not language-dependent.



If you have
suggestions or bugs to report, please let me know.
I can be reached via jxxcarlson at gmail.
