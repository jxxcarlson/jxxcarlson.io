title: "Type Theory, Agda and Some Good Books"
tags: fp

In my quest to understand type theory, I came across
links to two very good books. The first,
_[Programming Language Foundations in Agda](https://plfa.github.io/)_,
by Philip Wadler, is available online.  The second,
_Verified Functional Programming in Agda_, by Aaron Stump, is
also quite good, though pricey: $79.95 paperback, $51.19 kindle.
Ouf! I recommend both; they are certainly helping me to understand
the subject better.  The approach using Agda,
which stays close to the type theory of Per Martin-LÃ¶f, is
an attractive feature of these books.

NOTE: I've found Emacs to work more reliably with Agda than Atom.
I'd be interested to hear what the experience of others is.

### Other Agda resources

- [Agda User Manual 2.6.1](https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/agda/latest/agda.pdf)
- [Iowa Agda Library](https://github.com/cedille/ial)

There is some interesting material at [Introduction to Dependent Types and Agda,
8th Summer School on Formal Techniques](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/%7Eabela/ssft18/).
Unfortunately, some of the files are corrupted -- a text encoding problem?
