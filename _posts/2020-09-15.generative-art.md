In getting ready for RC, I've resurrected and old
[generative art repo](https://github.com/jxxcarlson/genart-kovach) which sets up a stack project
for the artwork described in [the post by Benjamin Kovach](https://www.kovach.me/posts/2018-03-07-generating-art.html). I had some trouble building it, despite the fact
that all the standard code for `stack` was in the repo.
I had forgotten that the C library Cairo had to be installed
separately, and that one had to have created the directory
`images/example_sketch`.  If these are not done in advance,
you will get difficult-to-understand (for me) errors when
you do `stack build` or `stack run`. The moral of the story:
always document the setup process in the README!  That
info is there now.

If you clone the repository and follow the directions, you should
produce an image like the one below:

<img src="/img/k1.png" width=400>
