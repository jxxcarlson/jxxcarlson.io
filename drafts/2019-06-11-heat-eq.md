I'm continuing to experiment with ways to speed
up some simulations in Elm that take a lot of
computation per step and which also produce
a lot of data to render.  Modeling the conduction
of heat, [as in the figure on the left](https://jxxcarlson.github.io/app/heat-model-gl.html),
 is a typical example.  There is an $n\times n$
grid of cells, each of which has its own
temperature $u(i,j)$, where the cell lies
in row $i$ and column $j$. Units are taken so that the
 $0 \le u \le 1$.
One (unsophisticated) way to render the
temperature is to assign a cell with temperature
$u$ the RGB value $(u, 0, 0)$, where $(1, 0, 0)$ is bright
red and $(0, 0, 0)$ is black.
The model operates by repeating the steps

1. Given the temperature field $u: (i,j) \to u(i,j)$ at time $t$,
compute its value at time $t + 1$.
2. Render the temperature field $u$.

Let's consider the first step. It involves
a computation of the average temperature of the
four nearest neighbors (East, West, North and South)
for each of the $(n-2)\times(n-2)$ interior cells â€” roughly $Cn^2$
computations per time step for some constant $C$.  Measurements with
[elm-benchmark](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-explorations/benchmark/latest/)
confirm a roughly quadratic dependence of the
time taken per update, with $t = 3.8\times(n/40)^2$
milliseconds per step as a crude approximation.
With $n = 100$, updating the temperature field
takes 24 milliseconds.  Thus, if rendering where
instantaneous, we could run the simulation at 40 frames
per sescond.  While this
not too bad, we would like to do still better.


Let's now consider rendeing.  My first try was to use SVG,
an approach which results in the creation of one DOM node
per grid cell each time step.  That is, $n^2$ DOM nodes
are generated per step.  This is an expensive process,
and when we get into the range of 10,000 DOM nodes per step,
the broswer responds sluggishly. Thus rendering via SVG is
limited in practice to $n < 100$.

A much better approach is to use WebGL, for which
there there is an excellent Elm Library
[elm-explorations/webgl](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-explorations/webgl/latest/).
Using WebGL, a single DOM node, a canvas,
is created at each time step.

The heat conduction simulation relies on a general cell-grid rendering package,
[jxxcarlson/elm-cell-grid](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jxxcarlson/elm-cell-grid/latest/). To render a temperature field in a 500x500
pixel region, one says this:

```
CellGrid.WebGL.cellGridToHtml 500 500 model.temperatureField colorMap
```

The function `colorMap`
has signature `Float -> Vec3`, where `Vec3`
is a 3-D vector of RGB values.
For rendering via SVG, one uses the older `CellGrid.Render` module:

```
CellGrid.Render.renderAsHtml 500 500 cellrenderer model.temperatureField
```

Here are heat conduction simulations for each of the two rendering methods:

- [Heat equation, SVG rendering, 70x70 grid](https://jxxcarlson.github.io/app/heat-model.html)
- [Heat equation, WebGL rendering 100x100 grid](https://jxxcarlson.github.io/app/heat-model-gl.html)

The source code for the apps is in the examples
folder of this [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/jxxcarlson/elm-cell-grid).

## Benchmark data

```
  n  Update  webGL  SVG
------------------------
 10    0.17  0.17   0.54
 20    0.66  0.77   2.3
 40    3.8   3.9   13.0
```

This crude, very limited data suggests that for the update function,
execution time is about $3.8\times 10^{-4}n^{2.5}$.
For the rendering functions, one finds $3.1\times 10^{-4}n^{2.3}$
and $1.3\times 10^{-3}n^{2.5}$.  These formulas were obtained
by assuming $Cn^a$ and comparing data in the last two rows
to obtain $C$ and $a$.  A naive theoretical analysis gives $a = 2$.

A word about the limitations on the data.

## Going further and faster: the GPU, WebGL and Futhark
